# SCILL Webhooks

These cloud functions are automatically published to a Firebase project `scill-webhooks` where they are accessible
by developers to chain specific challenges together. 

These webhooks are available:

## sendEventIfFinished

If the challenge is finished (i.e. type changes from `unclaimed` to `finished`) this webhook will send an event. You
can specific the event with query parameters:

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
| `event_name` | The name of the event (i.e. `craft-item` or `collect-item`) |
| `event_type` | The type of the event (i.e. `single` or `group` defaults to `single`)|
| `session_id` | The session id, if not provided defaults to the session id available in the webhook payload |

In addition to that, you can specify addition query parameters which are then packed in the `meta_data` part of
the event payload. 

**Please note**: You must specify them required parameters. Most events for example require an `amount` property to
be set.

For example, if you want to send an event if a challenge is finished, set this webhook in the Admin Panel:
`https://europe-west1-scill-webhooks.cloudfunctions.net/sendEventfFinished?event_name=trigger-event&amount=1&event_type=challenge_completed`

This will trigger a [trigger-event](https://developers.scillgame.com/events.html#trigger-event) with the meta data
`amount=1` and `event_type=challenge_completed`. This way, you could create another challenge that listens on the
`trigger-event` with `event_type=challenge_completed` and says: "Complete 100 challenges".

## collectXPIfFinished

This webhook will send a [collect-item](https://developers.scillgame.com/events.html#collect-item) event with `amount`
being the value set for `challenge_xp` in Admin Panel. I.e. for every completed challenge, this webhook will
send a `collect-item` with the number of XP set for that challenge. This way you can create another challenge
that says: "Collect 1000 XP". This is especially useful if you want to drive usage of your platform by linking
daily and weekly challenges together with a ranking based battle pass.

This way, users will only climb up in the battle pass level hierarchy if they also achieve personal challenges.
